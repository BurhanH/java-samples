## Main purpose

The idea is to show my knowledge and an ability to write Java code. Plus enhance coding skills.

### How it works

I write a simple algorithm on Java by adding one simple realization. Definitely, before writing actual code, I prepare a unit test for it. Then I push the code as PR into the main repository. And after some time (approximately 2-4 minutes) checking results. I mean check Travis CI (are there errors?), check Codacity (Is my PR up to coding standards?). If there are no errors I merge the PR into the master branch and those changes become a part of the main repository. If there are errors I make new commit into the PR to fix errors. Then I repeat a process from step 4 (sentence 4 of this paragraph) until changes will be merged with the master branch.

To be continue ...
